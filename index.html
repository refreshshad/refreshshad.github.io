			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<h4>The issue that we are trying to solve.</h4>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>Currently there is a plethora of self-care product available, ranging from shampoos and conditioners to acne creams and skin moisturizers. One thing the majority of these products have in common is that they come in small portions, most likely encased in a colourful, plastic container. While these may be appealing to the eye, when consumers are done with their product, they often have no option but to throw out the plastic and buying a new small, plastic bottle which they know will only last for a month or two. Plastic makes up 13% of the municipal solid waste stream, and an abysmally low 9% of all plastics are recycled. These numbers require a substantial change, and this is what ReFresh aims to provide with our new solution.</p>

			<h2>Our Solution</h2>
			<h4>How our service will fix this issue</h4>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>ReFresh takes its inspiration from Frozen Yoghurt stores in which customers can fill their cup with any possible combination of yoghurt flavours and toppings, and just pay based on the mass of their dessert. ReFresh realized the opportunity the implement the same system with shampoos and other self-care products, and has come up with a similar system to save countless plastic bottles from being produced. </p>
			<p>At our new stores, customers would bring in their own container, or purchase a biodegradable and ecofriendly glass mason jar at our location (of which there are three different sizes). Then, they would mass their container prior to obtaining any products, and have this mass recorded. After this customers can purchase any combination of products they like, either to test one out for the first time, try a combination of products, or to purchase a large portion of a trusted product. Once this is done, customers would simply weigh their creation on a scale, and would pay for its weight. Thus when they’re done at home, they simply wash out their container and bring it back and repeat the process, saving not only tons of plastic, but a lot of money as well.</p>

			<h2>Our Goals</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div style="width: 600px; margin: 0 auto">
				<p>Currently Canadians have the eight largest ecological footprint per capita in the world, and would require 3.5 Earths if everyone lived the same way we did, and ReFresh would like this to change. Plastic production is a huge factor in this, and on average it takes 450 years for plastic to decompose. With smart marketing and expansion, ReFresh hopes to decimate the plastic produced by the self-care industry, making consumers more conscious about the environment and more eco-friendly, and giving Canadians the option to keep living large on a small ecological footprint.</p>

			<h5>Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
		</div>
		
		<section class="row faq breath">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h6>Why should I refill?</h6>
				<p>Reusing your old plastic body care product containers will greatly reduce the production, transportation and disposal of harmful plastic. In most cases, plastic (4 out of 7 types produced) cannot be recycled but instead is collected in a landfill, leaking harmful toxins into ecosystems, affecting countless walks of life. This is detrimental for our environment, reducing the quality of air, the land, and water. By refilling at reFRESH you are part of an essential movement to further environmental sustainability.</p>
				<h6>How do we price our products?</h6>
				<p>We price by gram. This allows you to purchase a very small amount for sampling, and once you’ve found your perfect product, you can purchase large amounts such as a kilogram. This also allows you to refill before you container is completely empty. Local and organic products will be promoted as opposed to larger name brands and will be at a lower price to encourage our customers to try them out. The pricing of each product will be placed above each dispenser.</p>
				<h6>What kind of products do we sell?</h6>
				<p>We sell all sorts of body care products. That means, shampoo, lotions, conditioner, cleaning products, you name it. We purchase our products from local, artisan, organic producers, but also provide customers the option of buying big-name brands to ensure that there is a large variety to choose from.</p>
				<h6>How much plastic do I save by refilling at reFRESH?</h6>
				<p>It’s the smallest changes that make the biggest difference. Given our target market and estimated expansion rate, it is estimated that reusing body care bottles will account for 100 million plastic shampoo bottles saved.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h6>Are there any other advantages besides saving plastic?</h6>
				<p>ABSOLUTELY! Refilling allows you to try many different products without a substantial commitment. You can find the perfect shampoo that suits your hair, .and the most soothing lotion Everyone is different, and we care that you find the perfect product for you! You have the option of many different local, artisan and organic products at a lower price, but can also get tried and true large name brands that you’ve been with for years.</p>
				<h6>Can I bring my own container?</h6>
				<p>YES! We encourage customers to bring their own bottles as this increases the reduction of plastic waste and increases our sustainability. You can bring in plastic containers, yogurt containers, or anything you can think of. But if you really don’t have any, or if you forgot your bottle at home, we have an excellent collection of quality glass bottles in varying sizes that you could buy. Customers will be rewarded for buying a ReFresh jar through discounts.</p>
				<h6>Is there are a minimum amount I have to purchase?</h6>
				<p>No! That’s the beauty of refilling. You can buy as little or as much as you like. Since we use a pay  by weight system, this gives you all the flexibility in the world. </p>
